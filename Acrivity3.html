        <h1>Basic Structure of a Computer</h1>
        <p>A typical computer consists of hardware and software. The hardware includes the physical components such as the Central
        Processing Unit (CPU), memory (RAM), storage (hard drives or SSDs), and peripherals like keyboards and monitors. The
        software consists of the operating system (like Windows, macOS, or Linux) and various applications that allow users to
        interact with the hardware and perform specific tasks.</p>

        <h2>Functions of Computers:
        
        Data Processing: Computers can process vast amounts of data quickly, whether it's performing calculations, running
        simulations, or analyzing information.
        Storage: Computers store enormous amounts of data, from documents and images to databases and entire programs, enabling
        quick retrieval and manipulation.
        Communication: They connect people across the world via the internet, enabling email, video calls, and social media
        interactions.
        Automation: In industries, computers are used to automate tasks, reducing human error and improving efficiency.</h2>
